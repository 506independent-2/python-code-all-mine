#test 0003 DANGEROUS addition 
#is my precious baby, as it looks so satysfing, and it was ME  who made the code. i may not have made the language 
#myself but i made something using it. its like writing a succesful story, whilst you may not have made the language, you still made something 
#buetiful with it. and thats why i love my test 0003 so much. whilst it started its carrer as a test, its now a really satisfying program. run it
#, ignore the warnings. YOU WONT REGRET IT (unless you have pc that only has 500 mb of memory)!!! 
#be careful when you take a video, as it is most likely is going to look crap, and it will make my program look ugly, like multiplication.
#the same message has been put in a plaintext file, which sould be with the code
