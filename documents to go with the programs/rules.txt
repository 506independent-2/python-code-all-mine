definitons:
"small snippet" = code that is < then 15 lines
"large bits of code" = over 15 lines

to prevent "spreading", that was removed on 31/05/20, ensure any new idea is tested through test 0002. 
if it fails, copy it into test 0001 under a comment describing it.

for small, small snippets, then use test 0003. delete the code once you're done. if you like it too much,
for large code put it in test 0003 or the test 0004 for small snippets.

if it works, then make a new document, named on the lowest available number and copy your code there
